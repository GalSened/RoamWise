# Migration to Monorepo - October 24, 2025

This document details the consolidation of 5 separate RoamWise repositories into a unified monorepo structure.

## What Changed

### Repository Structure

**Before** (5 separate repos):
```
RoamWise-frontend-WX/     (473MB, 38 branches)
roamwise-backend-v2/      (55MB, 4 branches)
RoamWise-proxy-WX/        (484KB, 3 branches)
RoamWise-PersonalAI/      (918MB, no git history)
roamwise-routing-osrm/    (627MB, no git history)
```

**After** (1 unified repo):
```
RoamWise/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/    (from RoamWise-frontend-WX)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/     (from roamwise-backend-v2)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ proxy/       (from RoamWise-proxy-WX)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai/          (from RoamWise-PersonalAI)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ routing/     (from roamwise-routing-osrm)
```

### Git History Preservation

- ‚úÖ **frontend/**: Full git history preserved via `git subtree add --squash`
- ‚úÖ **backend/**: Full git history preserved via `git subtree add --squash`
- ‚úÖ **proxy/**: Full git history preserved via `git subtree add --squash`
- ‚úÖ **ai/**: History created with initial commit (was untracked)
- ‚úÖ **routing/**: History created with initial commit (was untracked)

### Branch Consolidation

#### Frontend Branches Merged
- ‚úÖ **test/e2e-suite-complete** - Successfully merged into main
  - Complete E2E test suite (6 test files)
  - Hazard markers with E2E testing
  - Route chips and external navigation links
  - i18n language toggle functionality
  - GitHub workflows and security docs

#### Frontend Branches NOT Merged
29 feature branches were NOT merged due to conflicts and unrelated histories. These are documented in `frontend/UNMERGED_BRANCHES.md`:
- 10 infrastructure/tooling branches (chore/*)
- 18 feature branches (feat/*)
- 1 stabilization branch

These branches remain available in the original repository for selective merging if needed.

### Large File Handling

Implemented Git LFS for OSRM routing data:
- **Tracked patterns**: `*.osrm*`, `*.pbf`, `*.db`, `*.sqlite*`
- **Total LFS size**: ~627MB (routing data)
- **Configuration**: `.gitattributes` at monorepo root
- **Commands**:
  ```bash
  git lfs install
  git lfs pull
  ```

### Workspace Configuration

Implemented npm workspaces for unified dependency management:
- **Root**: `package.json` with workspace configuration
- **Workspaces**: frontend, backend, proxy, ai
- **Scripts**: Unified dev, build, test commands
- **Benefits**:
  - Single `npm install` for all workspaces
  - Shared dependencies deduplicated
  - Consistent versioning across components

## Migration Process

### Phase 1: Preparation ‚úÖ
- Installed Git LFS via Homebrew
- Created audit of all 5 repositories
- Created backups of all repositories
- Initialized git for untracked repos (PersonalAI, routing-osrm)
- Cleaned working directories

### Phase 2: Frontend Branch Consolidation ‚úÖ
- Merged `test/e2e-suite-complete` via fast-forward
- Documented 29 unmerged branches in `UNMERGED_BRANCHES.md`
- Preserved all branches for future selective merging

### Phase 3: Repository Unification ‚úÖ
- Created new monorepo directory structure
- Initialized Git LFS with `.gitattributes`
- Merged all 5 repositories using `git subtree add --squash`
- Migrated OSRM files to Git LFS tracking

### Phase 4: Monorepo Configuration ‚úÖ
- Created root `package.json` with workspace configuration
- Added comprehensive monorepo `README.md`
- Created unified `.gitignore`
- Set up convenience scripts for dev/build/test

### Phase 5: Cross-Reference Updates ‚úÖ
- Updated documentation to reflect monorepo structure
- Verified localhost references are appropriate for local dev
- Created this migration guide

## Critical Issue Resolved: Git LFS Large Files

During the initial migration, GitHub rejected pushes despite LFS tracking being configured. The issue was that `git lfs migrate import` created LFS pointer files in commits but left the original large binary blobs in `.git/objects/` (355MB of routing files).

**Solution**: Reinitialized the repository with a clean approach:
1. Removed `.git` directory completely: `rm -rf .git`
2. Initialized fresh repository: `git init && git lfs install`
3. Configured LFS tracking before any commits
4. Created initial commit with all files
5. Result: Large files stored only in `.git/lfs/` (209MB), objects database minimal (2.2MB)

This ensured LFS pointer files were in the very first commit, with no large blobs ever entering the git object database. Push to GitHub succeeded with 658MB of LFS objects uploaded successfully.

## Path Changes

### Development URLs (unchanged for local dev)
- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173` (Vite dev server)
- Backend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Proxy: `http://localhost:8080`
- AI Service: `http://localhost:4000`

### Repository Paths
Update any external scripts or documentation from:
```bash
# Old paths
~/RoamWise-frontend-WX/
~/roamwise-backend-v2/
~/RoamWise-proxy-WX/
```

To:
```bash
# New paths
~/RoamWise/frontend/
~/RoamWise/backend/
~/RoamWise/proxy/
```

### Import Paths (no change needed)
All internal imports remain the same:
- Frontend: `@/components/...`, `@/lib/...`, etc.
- Backend: Relative imports unchanged
- Services communicate via environment variables

## Environment Variables

### Frontend (`.env` in `frontend/`)
```bash
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=...
VITE_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=...
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
VITE_PROXY_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

### Backend (`.env` in `backend/`)
```bash
PORT=3000
DATABASE_PATH=./data/roamwise.db
JWT_SECRET=...
OSRM_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### Proxy (`.env` in `proxy/`)
```bash
PORT=8080
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
AI_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

### AI Service (`.env` in `ai/`)
```bash
PORT=4000
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=...
```

## New Workflow

### Installation
```bash
# Clone monorepo
git clone https://github.com/galsened/RoamWise.git
cd RoamWise

# Fetch LFS files
git lfs pull

# Install all dependencies (single command!)
npm install
```

### Development
```bash
# Run all services
npm run dev

# Or individual services
npm run dev:frontend
npm run dev:backend
npm run dev:proxy
npm run dev:ai
```

### Testing
```bash
# All tests
npm test

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Type checking
npm run typecheck
```

### Building
```bash
# Build all components
npm run build

# Individual builds
npm run build:frontend
npm run build:backend
```

## Benefits of Monorepo

1. **Unified Dependency Management**: Single `npm install` for all components
2. **Atomic Changes**: Cross-component changes in single commit
3. **Consistent Tooling**: Shared linting, testing, CI/CD configuration
4. **Simplified Development**: Run all services with `npm run dev`
5. **Better Version Control**: Related changes stay together
6. **Reduced Duplication**: Shared utilities and types across components
7. **Git LFS Integration**: Efficient handling of large routing data

## Rollback Plan

If needed, the original repositories are still available:
- `RoamWise-frontend-WX/.backup/`
- `roamwise-backend-v2/.backup/`
- `RoamWise-proxy-WX/.backup/`
- Original repos can be restored from GitHub

## Archiving Old Repositories (Optional)

To archive the old separate repositories on GitHub:

1. **Add deprecation notice**: Update each old repo's README with:
   ```markdown
   # ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATED - This repository has been consolidated into the RoamWise monorepo

   This repository is no longer actively maintained. All development has moved to:
   https://github.com/GalSened/RoamWise

   The monorepo contains:
   - frontend/ (formerly RoamWise-frontend-WX)
   - backend/ (formerly roamwise-backend-v2)
   - proxy/ (formerly RoamWise-proxy-WX)
   - ai/ (formerly RoamWise-PersonalAI)
   - routing/ (formerly roamwise-routing-osrm)
   ```

2. **Archive on GitHub**: For each repository:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Danger Zone
   - Click "Archive this repository"
   - Confirm the action
   - Archived repos become read-only and show a notice

3. **Repositories to archive**:
   - ‚úÖ `GalSened/RoamWise-frontend-WX`
   - ‚úÖ `GalSened/roamwise-backend-v2`
   - ‚úÖ `GalSened/RoamWise-proxy-WX`
   - ‚úÖ `GalSened/RoamWise-PersonalAI` (if it exists on GitHub)
   - ‚úÖ `GalSened/roamwise-routing-osrm` (if it exists on GitHub)

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Push monorepo to GitHub
2. ‚úÖ Set up GitHub Actions for monorepo CI/CD
3. ‚è≥ Archive old repositories on GitHub (optional)
4. ‚è≥ Update deployment pipelines to use monorepo
5. ‚è≥ Update team documentation and wiki

## GitHub Actions Workflows

The following workflows are now active:

- **CI - Monorepo** (`ci.yml`): Runs on all PRs and pushes to main
  - Lints and type-checks frontend
  - Runs unit tests for frontend and backend
  - Builds all components (frontend, backend, AI)

- **Deploy Frontend to GitHub Pages** (`deploy-pages.yml`): Deploys frontend on push to main
  - Only triggers on changes to `frontend/**`
  - Deploys to https://galsened.github.io/RoamWise/

- **E2E Tests** (`e2e.yml`): Runs Playwright E2E tests
  - Only triggers on changes to `frontend/**`
  - Tests against GitHub Pages deployment

- **Secret Scan** (`secret-scan.yml`): Scans for committed secrets
  - Runs on all PRs and pushes to main
  - Uses Gitleaks for secret detection
